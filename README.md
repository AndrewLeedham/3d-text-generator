# 3D Text Generator
Very simple JavaSript based app. The idea arised from a random experimentation with the three.js library. The app basiacally allows a user to create a link(using url parameters) that will display their desired text in a basic 3D spinning animation, primarily for comedic effect within chat threads etc.

[Click here](http://andrewleedham.me/3d-text-generator) to use the app.
